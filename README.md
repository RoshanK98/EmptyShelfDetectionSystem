Introducing the Automated Empty Shelf Detection System, a pioneering solution in retail management, harnessing advanced technologies such as computer vision and AI to tackle enduring challenges, particularly in supermarket environments. 
This system targets the persistent issue of out-of-stock products by implementing real-time empty shelf detection and predicting on-shelf availability using machine learning algorithms. Manual tracking proves cumbersome and ineffective, underscoring the need for a more automated and precise approach. By employing cameras to capture live images and machine learning models to analyze them, the system generates alerts when empty shelves surpass predefined thresholds. 
Additionally, it conducts time series analysis to forecast future supply and demand, drawing insights from historical data and diverse factors. This research not only addresses current retail obstacles but also lays the groundwork for future enhancements, elevating operational efficiency and enhancing the overall retail experience. It reflects a dedication to revolutionizing conventional processes for heightened efficiency, precision, and customer satisfaction.
